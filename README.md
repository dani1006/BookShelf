<p>This project was developed to fulfill the submission of the Dicoding class Learning to Create Front-End Web for Beginners. The Bookshelf website is a simple application built using the concepts of DOM, session storage, and local storage. With a focus on understanding Front-End basics, this project aims to give beginner users practical experience in manipulating the DOM, storing data using session storage and local storage, and understanding the basic principles of interactive website development. 
It is important to note that this project was created as a reference to work on the submission and should not be replicated exactly.</p>
